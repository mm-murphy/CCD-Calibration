# CCD-Calibration

Here, I go over the calibration required for using a CCD to take astronomy data. For photometry, we use the SBIG STL1001E CCD. For spectroscopy, we use the SBIG ST402ME CCD with a DADOS spectrograph. 

This work was done as part of my lab course AST443 at Stony Brook University, Fall 2019.
